  "category": "oral",
  "topic": "workplace",
  "scene": {
    "context": "You're in a strategic planning session or executive meeting. Someone proposes an overly ambitious scope. This idiom elegantly pushes back while sounding experienced and pragmatic.",
    "formality": "formal"
  },
  "expressions": [
    {
      "phrase": "Let's not boil the ocean",
      "pronunciation_tip": "'lets-not-boil-the-o-shun' - 'ocean' flows into 'shun' sound",
      "usage_note": "Use when someone proposes something impossibly ambitious. This idiom means 'let's not try to do everything at once.' It signals strategic thinking and scope management."
    },
    {
      "phrase": "We need to socialize this",
      "pronunciation_tip": "'so-shuh-lize-this' - verb form, not the social media meaning",
      "usage_note": "Use when a decision or idea needs to be shared with stakeholders for input and buy-in before finalizing. Very common in corporate decision-making."
    }
  ],
  "alternatives": [
    "Let's not try to solve world hunger here",

  "chinglish_trap": {
    "wrong": "Don't do too much / Let's not be too ambitious / This is too big",
    "correct": "Let's not boil the ocean",
    "explanation": "Direct translations like 'don't do too much' sound unsophisticated in executive settings. 'Boil the ocean' is the idiom that shows you understand corporate strategic language. It's a metaphor for attempting something impossible (boiling the entire ocean) that originated in management consulting."
  },
  "examples": [
    {
      "situation": "Overly ambitious project scope",
      "dialogue": [
        "A: For Phase 1, let's rebuild the entire platform, add AI capabilities, and enter three new markets.",
        "B: I appreciate the ambition, but let's not boil the ocean. What's the minimum viable scope that still moves the needle?",
        "A: Fair enough. If we just focus on the platform rebuild first...",
        "B: That's more like it. And we should socialize this with the regional teams before locking it down."
      ]
    },
    {
      "situation": "Unrealistic timeline expectations",
      "dialogue": [
        "A: The CEO wants a complete digital transformation by Q2.",
        "B: Q2? That's boiling the ocean. We need to push back with a realistic phased approach.",
        "A: Should I prepare a presentation with the revised timeline?",
        "B: Yes, but socialize it with the key stakeholders first. Get alignment before going to the board."
      ]
    }
  ],
  "extended_learning": {
    "related_phrases": [
      "move the needle - make meaningful progress",
      "minimum viable - smallest workable version",
      "low-hanging fruit - easy wins",
      "nice-to-have vs must-have - prioritize features"
    ],
    "cultural_note": "'Boil the ocean' originated in management consulting (McKinsey, BCG) in the 1980s. It's now standard C-suite language. Using it correctly signals you think strategically and understand scope trade-offs. The idiom is particularly powerful because it's visual and slightly humorous while making a serious point.",
    "common_mistakes": [
      "Using it too casually - it's for strategic discussions, not daily tasks",
      "Using it to dismiss all ambitious ideas (some ambition is good)",
      "Not offering an alternative scope after using it",
      "Confusing 'socialize' with 'discuss' - socialize implies getting buy-in"
    ],
    "nuance": "'Socialize this' is uniquely corporate. It means systematically sharing an idea with stakeholders to gather input and build consensus. It's more deliberate than just 'discussing'—it's a process. In contrast, 'boil the ocean' is about avoiding overreach."
