    "wrong": "Let's discuss again later / Let's talk about this again",
    "correct": "Let's circle back on this",
    "explanation": "'Discuss again' sounds mechanical and direct. Americans prefer the spatial metaphor 'circle back' (returning to a point) which sounds more natural in corporate settings. It implies a planned return rather than just repeating."
