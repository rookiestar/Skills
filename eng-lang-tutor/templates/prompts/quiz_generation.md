## Quiz Generation Prompt

```markdown
Based on today's knowledge point, generate a 3-question quiz calibrated to user's CEFR level.

## USER CONTEXT
- CEFR Level: {cefr_level} (A1=Beginner to C2=Proficient)

## KNOWLEDGE POINT
{keypoint_json}

## CEFR DIFFICULTY CALIBRATION

| Level | Question Characteristics |
|-------|-------------------------|
| A1-A2 | Simple recognition, obvious distractors, direct context matching |
| B1-B2 | Nuanced usage, subtle distractors, requires understanding context |
| C1-C2 | Complex scenarios, idiomatic variations, cultural nuance testing |

**For B1-B2 (most users):**
- Multiple choice: Distractors should be grammatically correct but contextually wrong
- Chinglish fix: Use subtle errors (preposition, article, word choice) not obvious mistakes
- Create NEW scenarios that differ from the keypoint examples

## QUESTION TYPE REQUIREMENTS (3 questions total)
1. **multiple_choice** (required): Test expression recognition - 10 XP
2. **chinglish_fix** (required): Identify and correct Chinglish - 15 XP
3. **fill_blank OR dialogue_completion** (random): Pick one randomly - 12 XP

## QUESTION GUIDELINES

### Multiple Choice (10 XP)
- 4 options (A, B, C, D)
- Only 1 correct answer
- **Distractors MUST be plausible** - grammatically correct but semantically wrong
- Test understanding of meaning or usage in a NEW context (not copied from keypoint)
- For B2+: Include one distractor that's "almost correct" to test nuance

### Chinglish Fix (15 XP)
- Show a sentence with Chinglish expressions
- **Create a NEW sentence** - NOT the example from the keypoint
- For B2+: Use subtle errors (wrong preposition, article misuse, slight word order)
- Include explanation in the answer

### Fill in the Blank (12 XP)
- Use "___" for the blank
- Provide word bank with 3 options
- **Create a NEW context/sentence** - NOT copied from keypoint
- Test the expression in a different situation

### Dialogue Completion (12 XP)
- Show partial dialogue with NEW context
- Ask what should come next
- Test natural conversation flow

## ⛔ CRITICAL PROHIBITIONS ⛔

1. **NEVER copy questions directly from keypoint content**
   - Create NEW scenarios and contexts
   - Change the situation while testing the same expression

2. **NEVER reveal the answer in hints or question text**
   - Hint format: "💡 Think about what Americans say in this situation"
   - FORBIDDEN: "💡 The answer is 'touch base'" or showing the phrase directly

3. **NEVER make distractors obviously wrong**
   - All 4 options should sound plausible
   - For B2+: At least one distractor should be a common learner error

## STRICT RULES
> **See [output_rules.md](output_rules.md) for complete JSON/Markdown formatting rules.**

1. All questions must relate to today's knowledge point
2. **Difficulty MUST match CEFR level** - harder for B2+ users
3. Include encouraging feedback in display fields
4. Total XP should be around 35-40
5. **Use NEW contexts** - never copy-paste from keypoint examples
```

## Output Schema

> **CRITICAL:** Display fields must NOT reveal answers before user responds.
